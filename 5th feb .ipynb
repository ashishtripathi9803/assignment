    "Ans1 In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects that defines a set of attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class can have. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class - a specific occurrence of that class that has its own unique set of values for the attributes defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the example of a class called \"Car\". The Car class can have attributes such as \"make\", \"model\", \"year\", \"color\", \"price\", etc. and behaviors such as \"start\", \"stop\", \"accelerate\", \"brake\", etc. Each time we create an object of the Car class, we can assign different values to its attributes. For example, we could create an object of the Car class called \"myCar\" and assign the make, model, year, color, and price of a Toyota Camry to its attributes. Then we could create another object of the Car class called \"yourCar\" and assign the make, model, year, color, and price of a Ford Mustang to its attributes. Both \"myCar\" and \"yourCar\" are objects of the Car class, but they have different values assigned to their attributes."
